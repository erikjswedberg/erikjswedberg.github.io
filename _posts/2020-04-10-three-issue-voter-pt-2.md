## What's the Point of Politics Anyway

This is my second-ever post, and the second issue I find most important in the realm of politics.  Climate is an important issue on its own, but it also illustrates the role of government and politics in general.

### Climate Issue

Assume you believe in climate at all

  - If not, more than this blathering is needed

Assume you believe that climate is affected by humans

  - If not, inspect your motivations for this disbelief either financial or social, or based on propaganda from these

Assume you believe that something needs to happen about it

  - If not, some understanding of ecology connectedness might persuade you

Assume you believe that something should be done about it actively

  - If not, I expect you believe innovation will save us.

This last is a very possible and very convenient piece of propaganda.  It goes hand in hand with pointing out how climate scientists made predictions in the past that didn't come true (and a general aloofness for predictions).  Oil was going to run out, and yet we have more now than ever.  Remember that those predictions were saying, "Everything we know at this point indicates _____" instead of "We somehow know fracking is going to be invented between now and then and still we say _____".

You can't control discoveries, or plan on inventions.  I believe it possible that we will invent some cheap carbon-capture, ocean deacidifying, forest-growing wonder machine.. but it's possible in the same way that winning at a casino is possible.  You aren't sure of the percent exactly, but even though you know it isn't 0%, you really shouldn't bet your life on it.

So my assumptions leave us here.  Climate is real, timely, human affected, and requires active effort to resolve.

This is where the core of politics sets in.


### The Climate of Politics

My high school education in politics lays out a very binary picture of American politics.  You have Republicans vs Democrats, which can be described by central states vs coastal, low income vs high, less education vs more education, older vs younger,.. and on and on.  Religion is a sticky, thorny element thrown in there too. The big difference though is hands-off government vs hands-on government: how much should a government interfere/intervene in the normal lives of the populace.  What should government _do_?

It should be obvious that for all the opposing descriptions of these parties, the real truth is a fine gradation of detail, changing for each person and problem..  but we aren't living in a nuanced world these days.  So which approach is the best one?

There is a lot of sense in the hands-off approach.  Government is slow, and sloppy, and usually remote from any problem it is trying to help.  The people on the ground almost always have the closer perspective and know what is needed.  Or, in a more abstract sense, people will do what they want and nothing should get in the way of that.  The natural urges of the market surge and respond dynamically for every new development in the world, and rigid legislative structure getting in the way of that tide can only disrupt the natural flow of goods/money/effort/life.

So when would you ever want government at all?  Well for any problem/solution larger than the group.  Like having a military at all, or having protections for animals.  Or rights for everybody, not just some bodies.  Or ensuring drugs are real, safe, and effective, not just deceptively branded sugar.  Anything that is for the greater good that goes against a person's self interest, or the self interest of groups.  All of these things are good things (that most people would agree on) that would almost certainly never arise out of a free market.

Consider trying to coordinate a military when, well, the enemy isn't in _my_ town and that town over _there_ seems to have rounded up a militia just fine.  Try convincing the wealthy charlatan to stop convincing well-meaning fools that the cancer pills are just fakes.  I mean, what do I care about the town downstream tomorrow if it's way easier for me to dump my trash in the river today.

Certain problems fall inside of Camp Hands-Off, and certain problems fall into Camp Requires Better Angels.

### The Politics of Climate

The initial difficulty with solving any problem through government is that any solution is, by definition, arbitrary and a meager best efforts of flawed people.  It is a certainty that the "solution" will not be well designed, sufficiently funded, or properly executed.

But the _real_ pain is that these larger problems usually require solutions that go against the natural inclination of people and the market.  If left to their own devices, any reasonably self-interested person would run roughshod right over these solutions and keep the cash.

Now imagine a problem is so pervasive that almost every industry at least butts up against it.  Many industries directly profit from it, or shortcuts derived from it.  It is so basic that entire ways of life are centered around abusing it.  This problem is extremely expensive to resolve, and  effortless and profitable to ignore.  Not only will this problem cost you money to resolve, but it isn't even easy to talk about, let alone understand; the most confident, educated people on the subject can't say anything for certain about it.  Worst of all, the problem is slow.  It is the quintessential "Tomorrow's Problem".  And any proposed solution is far, far more complicated than any single issue a government has dealt with before.

So for this problem, which is the better type of governing style?

### Yes.  Regulate the Hell out of Climate Control

Because it is inconceivable that people or businesses will cut their own arms off by acting in the best interest of the planet otherwise.

An argument against regulation is a dewy-eyed fervor in the free market.

```"Don't hamper the market! Let the engines of industry burn hotter than ever and natural forces will surely solve this problem for us." ```

This is not entirely without merit, and certainly some positive things have arisen in the slim intersection of climate and profitability.

But come on, who are you kidding.  That "tomorrow's problem" type logic is mind boggling to me.  The scope of this problem is so big that coincidentally helpful advances will not change the outcome.  Nor will raising the cost of oil/whatever as it becomes depleted do be enough to counteract decades of past use, or be in time to matter.

### In Conclusion

If you can get a person to agree on those assumptions even partially, I feel like most reasonable people can come around on climate change regulation being necessary.

I don't think government will solve climate change well, or quickly, or cheaply.  I think the best you can hope for is that government will blunderbuss enough regulations to maybe hit the target eventually, probably, hopefully soon enough.  With luck, some innovation will help along the way.

The fact is though, any meaningful change is never going to happen without government forcing our collective hands.  There is just too much working against climate in the natural instincts at the individual/corporation/country level.

I put Climate second on my list, exactly because of the main roadblock:  vested companies lobbying misinformation to stymie real science and legislation.  If we can't even talk about what is real with climate without being interrupted by biased information, we just don't stand a chance of getting off the starting line on climate change, let alone fixing it before the terminal finish line.
