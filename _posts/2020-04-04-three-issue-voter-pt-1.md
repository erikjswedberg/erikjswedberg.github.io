## Where to begin

If you make a blog online, you might as well start with a political rant.

I have coalesced my political ideas down to three things that I _really care_ about.  The things that I would stand up for in a debate if I was ever in a position to.  Everything else, I would happily inflict my opinion upon in somebody else's debate but these I reserve have thought about specifically.

### Truth, Climate, and Privacy

These are in actually in priority order.

I honestly think that truth itself is the most important problem in government and society today.  There are many things I can say about Trump, but one of the many systemic weaknesses he has highlighted is how easy it is to deny something, and how narratives can be manipulated.

Just think in the abstract how easy it is to invalidate a claim compared to actually refuting it.  Proving something not to be true would involve countering facts or logic or at least some nuance in your response.  You either have to erode the foundation of the claim or work up the foundation of the counter-claim.  In any case, it's not easy, quick, or clear.  Now instead consider all it takes to deny something is valid at all--Trump does this all the time.

_Just side step the claim entirely:_
- "That is fake news"
- "That is partisan"
- "That is a hoax"

 Rhetorically you've completely upset the original claim with zero rhetorical work yourself.  You've swept the rug out from under your oponent.  While they are reeling, playing by the rules and working up a blustering defense of their foundation of truth, the sound bite has already gone out.  Are people going to tune in to your response?  (or will their news repeater of choice bother mentioning it)  And you've now got twice the work to do: proving it is true and now proving that it's valid.

 Why would a person do this?  Why undermine instead of acknowledge?  Can we trust the original claimant, or the denier?  If you heard this argument on the news, could you trust that this is an accurate representation of what they said (let alone of what is true)?

 This is a rhetorical example of a larger problem.  When there are so many reasons for truth to be obscured, how can anybody actually receive true facts about reality.

### How Does Anyone Know What to Believe

Even the most generous, patient, open person doesn't have a chance to understand what is real and what is is manipulation.  You can read both sides and listen to original sources, but few others will put in that work.  Even if you do, the sources relaying that information have their own bias, how can you weigh their bias versus others?  What about the content of the information, will you research every individual involved to see if they have conflicts of interest?  Say you do this too, how do you know the general scope of the problem besides the framing of the original claim?  Is this statistic simply number-play, where "per capita" is missing, which would tell the opposite story, for example. There are so many barriers in your way if you really want to know the truth of just a single fact, let alone the torrent of relevant, important world facts happening every day.

How can one possibly know what is true when basic faith in anything has been completely undermined?

Several of the people around me in my life have different responses to this.  It can be highly amusing, where you can see people completely splutter and flail in the face of fact-denial.  It can turn to conspiracy, where knowledge that China or Russia are influencing the news and details involved, so you really can't know what to trust at all.  I personally fall into a hands-in-the-air hopelessness about the whole situation--I imagine the average person falling prey to inherent manipulations and can't see any way toward harmony and progress.

### Towards Reality

I think that this problem is exactly the kind that needs governance to sort out.  Any individual or company is always going to spin reality to best serve their own interest.  Why would anybody be motivated to sacrifice themselves for the sake of abstract truth?  Nobody is going to be a saint voluntarily.

An important caveat is that truth is not always possible.  Many issues that come up are, in fact, matters of opinion and these issues obviously have less intersection with the truth-seeking I'm talking about here.  The only overlap is when opinions quote or make claims that are actually biased/false/ill-intended that need outside moderation.

- News sources should be subsidized by the government (but not completely) based on their accuracy
  - _The amount to which a company is beholden to their source of income is directly proportional to how far they would go to stay in business by any means_
  - Perhaps half and half, so the news can be trusted not to toady up to government, but also not be completely controlled by free market whims and attention seeking
- Meaningful debates in public (news interviews to party nominations) are completely backwards, seeking entertainment at the cost of information. Newscasters and websites are looking for 15 second sound bites or page views instead of earnestly determining and spreading truth
  - _What is really important here, getting facts about the issue or having an entertaining segment?_
  - And for god's sake don't have counter interviewers just for the hell of it.  If a thing is true, don't undermine it by having some quack come on just to disagree or have conversational symmetry
- News sources should fact check their primary sources and secondary sources
  - _This should go without saying but pains me how much it needs saying_
  - Fake news is embarrassing.  Imagine a world where that claim was laughable and people had faith that reporting was accurate (or at least earnestly well researched)
  - I separate out intentionally deceitful news only intended to spur chaos from news that is just so biased and ungenerous that it is practically lying.  The former is probably foreign-powered, but the latter is just embarrassing
  - "You had _one_ job."
- News sources should research and divulge their primary and secondary sources for conflicts of interest
  - _Why should we trust the "expert analysis" of somebody who is being paid by somebody relevant to the claim_
  - My God, why did anybody allow smoking companies to talk about their own research about the safety of smoking.  Or fast food.  Or oil, or....
- Important videos online should be moderated to be actually representing reality
  -  _Video is fast, and attention online is fleeting.  The onus is on the provider to ensure first-watch takeaways are valid (consumers will not do research)_
  -  Ideas are so viral, and any one person can watch a video and get incorrect information, then share it with thousands of others. This is a failing of human nature, but the way through this is not expecting the individual to fact check every claim they hear, it just isn't feasible.
- Platforms that convey news and information about the world must be held responsible fo the news and information about the world that they convey
  - _How can you seriously argue against this with any shred of honesty_
  - Facebook is huge, and complex.  They didn't set out to be a shaper of minds and don't want that responsibility..  but now it _is_ that, and who else but them can possibly fix that but themselves
  - Innovation is precious, hard to cultivate, and easy to squash.  But you can't allow anything that isn't yet against the rules just because we haven't suffered enough for it to be in the rulebook. Particularly when it is a wealthy, lobbying, complicated, easy-to-ignore problem
- An agency should be created to vet and validate corporations and websites
  - _Claims about the world can be made by companies as well as individuals that are meant to serve themselves, not society_
  - Only a governmental agency would be trusted (compared to a private one)
  - Can you imagine a world where the oil companies, having done the research to discover climate change was real, acted against their own profits and worked to reduce emissions?  A company would never make that decision in a free market without external governance.
  - This is not an easy problem, nor would the answer be True/False.  Off the top of my head, I'd imagine "True (factually)", "True in spirit",  "True at the time", "True (opinion)", and so on.  An article would have each fact mentioned be called out as such, and the article overal be given an average of sorts.  The website, and the company would also get averages.
  - Any news source of significant size with insufficient truth value would not be allowed to distribute information
- The Agency of Truth will also be responsible for collating and providing unbiased information and training to Senators.  The people who are responsible for making decisions about issues must have accurate information about those issues.  They cannot be allowed to be manipulated
  - _Why hasn't anyone realized that they don't understand technology, and have huge blindspots about it and anything similarly complicated?_
  - When Facebook came under fire for privacy violations, watching them completely stumble their way through was so painful.  Why had nobody briefed them, or tutored them, about the very basics of the issue?  They didn't even know the right _kinds_ of questions to ask, let alone ask anything pointed enough to get a meaningful answer from the defendant
- Senators or people in political power need to divest from financial conflicts completely while they are in office.  Also, lobbying needs to be regulated far more
  - _How can we possibly trust so much power to normal, flawed individuals and hope they won't be swayed by their very nature_
  - Take the average income for a Senator, including investments, and double it.  Then demand they sign away their stock market actions to somebody else or just step out of that game altogether while in office.
  - Just give the president a million dollar salary.  Or a ten million dollar salary.  The president should be the most separated person in the country from conflicts of interest.  The fact that this is only relevant now is a Trumpian reality, but it should have been in place from the founding fathers
- Any act by a foreign power to alter the "understanding of reality" of our citizens is as much an act of war as landing spies in our midst intent on sowing chaos
  - _Skills, goods, people are all assets that make up this country's strength and value, but so is the collective understanding of reality_
  - It seems obvious to me that if the US worked to undermine the people's understanding of the world in China, perhaps cast doubt between political parties, that the response would be clear.  Why is the reverse not also the case?
    - Honestly I don't know Russia's long term plan.  "Chaos" is clearly the first step though, and it is working alarmingly well
- Any act by a foreign power to influence a person of power should be an act of war
  - _The people should implicitly trust that those in power are acting solely for the good of this nation and the world, not the nation that pays them or influences them_
  - It's like assassinating a polititian's credibility, or converting them to commit treason.  The degree is different, but influencing a polititian is in the same category and just as problematic.
