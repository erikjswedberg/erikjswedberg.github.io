## Privacy talk, from a Overly Exposing Political Blog?

There are many other issues to be riled up about, many even that are more pressing or life-threatening than this.  Many issues about wars or medicine or industry or global politics.  Many things are important, but I think Privacy in the Modern Age is a snake-in-the-grass kind of problem.  A tempting-smell-leading-to-slaughter kind of problem.  One of those insidious, incipient problems that only bites you when you're 3 decades later and you realize you live in a dystopia.

### What I Talk About When I Talk About Privacy

I really mean data and advertising, but these innocuous sounding market forces are shaping society in a bad way.

Capitalism needs advertising.  People won't buy anything they haven't heard of.  Intruding into the eyeball-space of a person's life experience is practically the only entry point to selling them your product.  This has been a cornerstone of bartering and capitalism.  I am not sure if or how the world would work if a magic wand was waved and advertising was no more.

But now that technology has changed the human experience forever (yet again), advertising has gotten out of control.

Now, all of the corporate interest and profit in advertising is directed at discovering more and more data about the individual.  This is complicated, technical, and hard to explain--which of course makes the task of regulating it all the more difficult.

### Common Response

```I've got nothing to hide, what's the problem if they take my data?```

You don't understand what is happening, and that is expected.  This is new, wild-west type stuff.  Frankly, even the best computer people don't fully understand how computers work, and expecting the average person to understand even the basics is too much.

Let's fall back to analogy.

Imagine a service where you have your own personalized robot butler ready to help you 24 hours a day.  This butler will wait tirelessly outside your home and be ready for you whenever you go open your door and ask for anything.  The Butler will instantly retrieve it for you.  This Butler will even learn about your requests, so it can serve you better as time goes on.

Surely this is a good thing, and an innocent one, for this butler will not enter your home.  This butler only sees you when you go to it, and only knows what you tell it.  And this butler is free, slave-less, intelligent, and genuinely provides you with an incredible service.

### The Butler is the Internet

What you don't realize though, is that the butler is a robot and not a robot.  The butler is the world's best robots and legions of the best minds all rolled into one.  This butler only interacts with you when you seek it out, but..

- it sees your shoes and knows where you've been
- it sees your face and knows what you are feeling
- it remembers absolutely everything you have ever asked of it
- it can hear everything you say outside, and remembers that too
- it knows the other butlers, and they tell it about all of your friends
- it sees through the door at your family or children (let alone that the children also talk to it)

If you aren't startled by even this rough analogy, I haven't stretched this point enough.

This butler knows volumes about you by now.  It knows libraries about you.  This butler literally creates fake robotic versions of you and simulates what they will want and do in order to serve you better.  These robotic versions of you are very accurate, more than you would believe is possible.

From the information gleaned above, this butler knows if you are gay.  It knows who you will vote for. It knows if you are considering getting married.  It knows your children and your parents and what they are doing.  It knows when you get home from work each day, and what you like to do to relax.

### Perhaps Unsettling, but Problematic, Really?

If you are still unphased by this, try to believe that I am not overstating--I am understating to fit my analogy.  The reality is even more insidious.

See, the butler is the internet, and the butler is every company on the internet.  The more information they can individually and collectively gather about you, the more money they can make.

- If you are a company selling diamond rings, how much money would you pay to put an advertisement in front of people statistically likely to want to get married soon?
- If you are a political candidate, how much money would you pay to put a message in front of swing voters who care the most about _that specific issue_?
- If you sell big stuffed teddy bears, how much money would you pay to put a cutesie cartoon of a teddy bear in front of a child right before their birthday?

Data is money.  Try to imagine how much sense this makes to a company.  Not too long ago, a billboard was ok, a magazine placement was better, and the real golden ticket of advertising was word of mouth.  If you could have a product "speak for itself", such that customers would advertise to their friends for you.  Now, Data is that friend.  Data will send your advertisement directly to the people most likely to pay for your product, right at the moment they are thinking about needing it.

A billboard targets everybody driving nearby.  A magazine targets people interested in that magazine topic.  Data targets people who don't even know they want that product but are most likely to pay for it.  It is the surgical-strike SEAL team of advertising, but with robots.

### Connect the Dots

I sometimes feel like a conspiracy theorist for how much this concerns me.  Perhaps I am, but can't tell.

For example, Google.

Google isn't an android company, nor a pixel phone company or a map company or an email company or even a search company.  Literally every one of Google's many varied products has been secondary to data capture and advertising, and it has worked fantastically well for them financially.  They were a data capture company before everybody else was aware of it, and they are now one of the most powerful companies in the world.

Hopefully you can see how the market incentives cannot possibly be more skewed towards data collection.

Hopefully you can see, at least a little bit, how much real, meaningful information can be gleaned from "harmless little details" that you leave around the internet.

I haven't even delved into the real conspiracy territory of illegal data capture, or Internet-of-Things devices and their myriad problems, or data brokerage companies whose only purpose is to collect and sell data to other companies.  Or the political effects of data advertising manipulation.  Or data hacking and data theft entirely.

But what I hope to impart on you is that there are a lot of money reasons to collect data and it is just about entirely unprotected.

### Ok, Maybe.  But What's the Problem?

It's not all bad.  The Butler really is a great service.  Advertising really does make the flow of goods in a market run smoother.  Connecting with other like minded people through technology is adding otherwise impossible experiences.  Secondary technology from data crunching helps out other industries.  There are many conveniences and true innovations to be gained here.

But we have already seen the problems about data capture and manipulation too.  Russian hacking of elections.  Overpurchasing stuff.  "Free" phone apps that make money off of data capture.  Youtube's child-based economy of videos.  Almost everything about cellphones.  I fret the possibilities given the power, incentives, and lawlessness involved.

I actually have a whole set of separate thoughts about how making money from advertising has changed websites to focus on number of views instead of value.  The faster and more engaging/irritating/enraging/sharable the content is, the more money you'll make.  Overall, the internet has become a shallow and largely meaningless attention marketplace, responsible for countless lifetimes of wasted time.

But that's a story for another rant post

### Why it is a Political Issue

Obviously the market will not self regulate.

### Why I would Vote For Somebody Who Even Mentions This

The government is old and does not understand technology.  It is an embarrassing trainwreck anytime anybody goes up before Congress to talk about a political issue.  They had Mark Zuckerberg there, the Czar of Data Capture, and they couldn't even understand which way was up, let alone how to interrogate him on his business practices.

They are not behind the curve on the problem of technology, they are miles away from it.  They are miles away, facing the wrong direction, being dragged slowly towards it.  And the pace of technology is accelerating faster and faster away from them.

Let me repeat, there are almost no protections about data and privacy.  The California Consumer Protection Act is a good first baby step, and the European one was ahead of it's time a few years ago.  But the gold is just laying there on the river bed and companies are already clambering to get it.

How long will we have to wait for meaningful protective legislation to happen if nobody in government even knows how to describe the problem?
